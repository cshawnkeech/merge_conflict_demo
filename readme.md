# Merge Conflict Demonstration

A small file to aid in demonstrating merge conflicts.

there are often merge conflicts when two people edit the same files at the same time in the same place.

When one person is editing it's not so bad.

We do what we can, but sometimes it keeps on happening.

All of this text is on the new branch.
